{"name":"OxwallMessenger (POC)","tagline":"A native iOS app to power your Oxwall Social Networking site.","body":"# Oxwall Messenger\r\n\r\n**[OxwallMessenger](http://tochman.github.io/OxwallMessenger/)** connects to a Oxwall powered site and provides the user with messaging functionality.\r\n\r\n**Oxwall** is a social networking software platform written in PHP/MySQL. Oxwall is used for a wide range of projects starting from family sites and custom social networks to collaboration tools and enterprise community solutions. **You can find more info about Oxwall at: [www.oxwall.org/](http://www.oxwall.org/).** \r\n\r\n**We are ready to kick off our Beta program.** We have been working on out app for the last month and now we are ready to let you have a saying in all this. Also, we need to test how the app is behaving on other devices than the simulator and development enviroment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to participate. you'll need to:\r\n1. Sign up at www.scalo.se for a user account. That is our Oxwall Demo Site.\r\n2. Sign up for the Test Team at http://tflig.ht/19EnEct or, if you already have a TestFligt account, send me your account e-mail and I'll send you a team invite.\r\n3. Visit www.testflightapp.com with your iOS device and follow these steps to register your device UDID.\r\n4. Install the app on your device when a notification mail arrives or when you see it in your TestFlight dashboard. \r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me with any questions at thomas [at] nocebo.se If you'd like to contribute to this project I'll be very happy! \r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![Oxwall Messenger for iOS Flow](http://cloudshare.se/webservice/OM-flow-1.jpg)\r\n## Contribute\r\nIf you think this project is interesting and you want to contribute to the development just fork the repo and start coding! This is how open source projects begin, grow, thrive and reach new users. **Let's make this happen!**\r\n\r\n## Open Source\r\n**This is Open Source - Okay, but what does it mean?**\r\n\r\n* You have the right to **Share** — to copy, distribute and transmit the work\r\n* You have the right to **Remix — to adapt the work**\r\n* You have the right to **make commercial use** of the work\r\n\r\nThat means it is you are welcome to download and modify the code if you want. You may also use the code in commercial products and solutions without violating the license agreement - but I prefer that you, if you choose to distribute the code, do it without charging for it. We all have to live, eat and feel good, but it is better to charge for services and customizations than outright sell the source code that you only partially been creating. It feels more morally correct. But it is still up to you.\r\n\r\n> **Doesn’t \"open source\" just mean something is free of charge?**\r\n\r\n> No. This is a common misconception about what \"open source\" implies. Programmers can charge money for the open source software they create or to which they contribute. But because most open source licenses require them to release their source code when they sell software to others, many open source software programmers find it more lucrative to charge users for software services and support rather than for the software itself. This way, their software remains free of charge and they make money helping others install, use, and troubleshoot it.\r\n\r\n>**[opensource.com](http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)**\r\n\r\n## Contract work\r\n\r\n**We run a small consulting and training company, NoceboDesign, and we are available for contracting. If you want to make use of Oxwall Messenger in your business but do not know how to go about to make this yourself, you are welcome to get in touch with us. We are here to help.**\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>.\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\nThis project uses (among others):\r\n\r\n* JSONModel: [https://github.com/icanzilb/JSONModel](https://github.com/icanzilb/JSONModel)\r\n* MessagesTableViewController: [https://github.com/jessesquires/MessagesTableViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/MessagesTableViewController) \r\n* ODRefreshControl: [https://github.com/Sephiroth87/ODRefreshControl](https://github.com/Sephiroth87/ODRefreshControl)\r\n* NewRelics Application Performance Management & Monitoring","google":"UA-44171196-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
