**[OxwallMessenger](http://tochman.github.io/OxwallMessenger/)** connects to a Oxwall powered site and provides the user with messaging functionality.

**Oxwall** is a social networking software platform written in PHP/MySQL. Oxwall is used for a wide range of projects starting from family sites and custom social networks to collaboration tools and enterprise community solutions. **You can find more info about Oxwall at: [www.oxwall.org/](http://www.oxwall.org/).** 


Demo app to show how to connect to Oxwall DB using a set of webservices. Hopefully some day this will turn into a product that admins of Oxwall powered social sites can use.
